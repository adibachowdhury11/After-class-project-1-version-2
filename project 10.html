                    <dd>In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, education is a window through which
                    distant
                    objects can be
                    viewed closely. There is no alternative to education for the development of a person's
                    personality. The
                    necessity of
                    educational institutions is essential for the orderly quest for knowledge. From this
                    realization, a few
                    individuals in
                    the heart of Brahmanbaria city felt the need for an ideal educational institution. With their
                    efforts, this
                    institution
                    began its journey in 1910. Over the course of time, the institution has traversed more than a
                    century. Since
                    its
                    inception, the school has been committed to spreading the light of education, fostering creative
                    talents,
                    and shaping
                    skilled generations.
                    
                    Currently, we are tirelessly working with a group of talented, highly educated, skilled, and
                    trained
                    teachers to build
                    responsible citizens, while keeping up with information and communication technology. In order
                    to establish
                    our position
                    in this competitive world while facing the challenges of the 21st century, the development of
                    information
                    technology is
                    indispensable. In recognition of this necessity, various activities have already been undertaken
                    to ensure
                    the use of
                    technology at Niyaz Muhammad High School. Notable among these are classes using audio devices,
                    multimedia
                    classrooms,
                    and class activities conducted with digital content created by teachers.
                    
                    We express our heartfelt gratitude and congratulations to all the dedicated individuals,
                    teachers, and
                    well-wishers who
                    have lovingly brought the school to this point since its establishment in 1910. We also
                    respectfully
                    remember and
                    congratulate all former students of this school, especially those who have made and continue to
                    make
                    significant
                    contributions to building a beautiful, fair, and transparent world.
                    
                    I seek the cooperation of everyone for the overall development of this institution. I am hopeful
                    that this
                    school will
                    become one of the leading institutions in the country, aimed at building a technology-driven and
                    scientifically-minded
                    nation.

                            <p>As a student of Niaz Muhammad High School, I am proud to be part of an institution that has a rich
                            history and a
                            strong
                            commitment to academic excellence. Established with a vision to provide quality education, our
                            school has been a
                            beacon
                            of learning and growth in Brahmanbaria.
                            
                            Niaz Muhammad High School is more than just a place to learn; it is a nurturing environment where
                            students are
                            encouraged to achieve their full potential. The dedicated faculty members work tirelessly to ensure
                            that each
                            student
                            receives personalized attention and support. Their passion for teaching and commitment to our
                            success is evident
                            in
                            every class.
                            
                            The school’s curriculum is designed to be comprehensive and challenging, preparing us for both
                            academic and
                            personal
                            success. Beyond academics, our school offers a range of extracurricular activities that help us
                            develop a
                            well-rounded
                            skill set. Whether it's participating in sports, cultural events, or community service, there are
                            numerous
                            opportunities
                            for us to grow and explore our interests.
                            
                            What sets Niaz Muhammad High School apart is its emphasis on character building and values. We are
                            encouraged to
                            be
                            responsible, compassionate, and proactive citizens. The sense of community and mutual respect among
                            students and
                            staff
                            creates a positive and inspiring atmosphere.
                            
                            In summary, Niaz Muhammad High School is a place where education goes beyond textbooks. It is a
                            supportive
                            community
                            that fosters growth, inspires curiosity, and prepares us for a bright future. I am grateful to be
                            part of such a
                            remarkable institution and look forward to continuing my journey of learning and discovery here.</p>

                            <p>After the British government in India replaced Persian with English as the official
                            language, Indian
                            Muslims
                            abandoned
                            English. Consequently, Indian Muslims soon faced ruin due to a lack of education. Sir Syed Ahmad
                            Khan took steps
                            to
                            protect Indian Muslims from destruction. After much struggle, he encouraged them to learn English
                            and
                            established

                            The Muslims of Brahmanbaria also faced the risk of ruin due to lack of education. Following Sir Syed
                            Ahmad
                            Khan's
                            example, several prominent Muslim figures and social workers in Brahmanbaria city came forward to
                            establish an
                            English
                            school in the city. They were: the late Munshi Abdul Kadir, the late Abbas Khan, the late Syed
                            Mohammad Ali, the
                            late
                            Khan Bahadur Abdur Rauf, and the late Khan Sahib Ansar Ali Muktar.<br><br>
                            
                            On March 3, 1910, they established George Minor School (George M. E. School) on a vacant plot of
                            land on the
                            eastern
                            side of Brahmanbaria Sadar Thana. It is noteworthy that during British rule, a high school could not
                            be
                            established
                            directly. Initially, it was a minor school and later upgraded to a high school. Due to a significant
                            increase in
                            students, the school was relocated to the Modail region (its current location). In 1914, it was
                            upgraded to
                            George
                            High
                            English School and in 1919, it received permanent recognition from the University of Calcutta. Soon,
                            the school
                            became
                            filled with both Hindu and Muslim students due to its high-quality teaching staff.

                            building
                            designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments
                            for the teaching of students under the direction of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal
                            education,
                            which is
                            sometimes compulsory.[2] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools that can be
                            built
                            and
                            operated
                            by both government and private organization. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in

                            who have
                            completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught is commonly called a

                            college or
